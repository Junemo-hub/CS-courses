# 📘 MIT 6.006: Introduction to Algorithms

This repository contains my personal notes, problem sets, and code related to MIT's 6.006 course: **Introduction to Algorithms**.

🧠 The course covers fundamental algorithmic concepts such as:
- Asymptotic analysis
- Divide and conquer
- Dynamic programming
- Graph algorithms
- Hashing and search structures
